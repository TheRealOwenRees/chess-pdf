## A chess PGN to PDF conversion tool

## About
This project allows the user to load a chess PGN file into a chessboard, choose which moves they require to render as diagrams, and then save as a PDF complete with annotations.

The project relies on a custom TexLive server for typesetting purposes. See [this project](https://github.com/TheRealOwenRees/chess-pdf-api) for more details.

## Tech Stack

## Limitations
The current limitations of this project include:
- Does not currently render commends made before a move
- Does not render annotations of variations
- Does not allow diagrams of variations

These limitations are part of our roadmap, and would make for great contributions from the open source community.
